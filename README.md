# Expense Tracker - A Web Application
This project was made for our course, Applications Development and Emerging Technologies 2 (Enterprise-Back-End).
We were tasked to create a web application (using JSPs) with a MySQL database.
Aside from that, we were also asked to apply what we have learned from
freeCodeCamp's [Responsive Web Design tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/).

# Description
The web app has a login system for users wherein the credentials must be created first in the database. CRUD is implemented in the expense system that allows the user to keep track of the user's expenses and income. The total income, expenses, and remaining balance of the user is computed based on all the expense and income entries.
